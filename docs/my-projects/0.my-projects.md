### My Projects (Page in progress)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This page includes summary of some of the work I have completed for my undergraduate research, independent project, and coursework projects.   

#### Undergraduate research work:  
I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with professor Daisuke Kihara and fellow undergraduate researchers in the Kihara Bioinformatics Laboratory. Our project involved ivestigating the potential of generative machine learning methods in novel drug molecule generation. I have included 2 pages that briefly describe some computational work I have done for the analysis of computer generated drug compounds: [Molecular Docking](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/docking_ligands.html), and [Tanimoto Drug Similarity](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/tanimoto_calc.html).   

I also had the pleasure to work with Dr. Martinez, a postdoctoral researcher from the Kawahara Lab. His work involved phylogenetic classification of the Noctuoidea (owlet moth) family, which required computational analysis of whole genomes sequenced from a large number of specimen. The pages titled [Processing of MSA](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/process_MSA.html) and [Removal of Duplicated Sequences](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/remove_duplicates.html) detail some of the work I have done to assist Dr. Martinez in his project. 

#### Independent project: 
RNA-seq project coming soon. 

#### Coursework project: 
The pages titled [Python Game](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/biol595proj.html) and [Genomic Ranges Assembly Tool](https://nhwivo.github.io/docs/my-projects/genomic%20ranges%20assembly.html) are projects I have completed in one of my computational biology courses.
